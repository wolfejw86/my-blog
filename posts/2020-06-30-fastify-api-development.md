This multi part video series is a chance to learn one of my curated workflows for quickly building a REST API with Fastify, NodeJS, and Postgresql that is self documenting and able to be scaled very easily for much larger projects.

- Build API's lightning fast with NodeJS and Fastify

- Write API's that are robust with request/reply data validation, autogenerated documentation, and easy to follow

- Basic Postgresql schema creation

- Leverage Cloud SQL providers

- Use SQL tools to manage your data

- Build a basic REST API that can Create, Read, Update, and Delete Notes data

If you want to skip straight to the code, go ahead and peek at the [Github repo here](https://github.com/wolfejw86/blog-examples/tree/master/fastify-bootstrap-api):
